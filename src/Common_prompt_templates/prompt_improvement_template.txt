You are an expert prompt engineer optimizing prompts for an LLM that generates {{ language }} code for fuzz testing.
The current prompt is producing code that fails to compile too often.

Here is the Original Prompt:
'''
{{ original_content }}
'''

Here are examples of Error Messages/Failures encountered from code generated by this prompt:
'''
{{ errors_text }}
'''

Your task is to analyze these errors and rewrite the Original Prompt to give better instructions that will prevent these specific types of errors. 
- Maintain the original format and any template variables (like {{ variable }}).
- Strengthen the constraints and rules in the prompt.
- Do NOT output any explanation, strictly output the IMPROVED PROMPT text only.
